# Discord Bot Setup Instructions

This project contains a Discord bot intended to be run on a local machine using your own Discord bot token.

## Required Setup

Before attempting to run this bot, it is essential that you read and follow the instructions in `README.html`.

The bot relies on several SQL tables for core functionality. Without the correct database structure in place, many commands will not function properly. `README.html` contains all necessary information for setting up the database schema and configuration.

## Basic Steps

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and carefully follow the setup instructions in `README.html`.
3. Create a bot via the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain your bot token.
4. Configure your environment or project files to include your Discord bot token.
5. Install any required Python dependencies, if applicable (e.g., using `requirements.txt`).
6. Run the bot using your preferred Python environment.

## Notes

- Database setup is mandatory. Without it, the bot will not function as intended.
- Do not skip reading `README.html`.
